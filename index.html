                                Mako grew up carefree. Living in the woods with her human mother, Kinna. She didn’t know
                                a lot about her father - only that he was an Orc named Cidrak, and that she had his
                                eyes. Most of her days were spent playing in the garden and nearby wood, making enemies
                                in her imagination and slaying them heroically with sticks that she felt looked exactly
                                like daggers.
                                <br><br>
                                Her mother was a herbalist who spent most of her days cultivating her garden, brewing
                                simple potions and occasionally travelling to the nearby town to trade. She was kind and
                                patient, and the only time there was any sharpness to her voice was when she told Mako
                                to make sure the townspeople never saw her, and exactly where to hide in the pantry so
                                she couldn''t be seen by a passing gaze. Mako wasn't entirely sure why, but the way her
                                mother said it easily convinced her that it was important.
                                <br><br>
                                Their quiet, comfortable life was shattered one Autumn evening when Mako was seven years
                                old. Earlier that day, a man had approached the house in a run and Mako had noticed him
                                too late. She thought she had been quick enough when she spotted him and ran from the
                                garden to her space behind her mother's stacked baskets in the pantry. The man had been
                                in a panic and asked her mother to bring supplies to help heal one of the townsfolk who
                                had suddenly fallen ill. She could recall clearly now the memory of her mother entering
                                the pantry, picking up several items - a bundle of herbs, several flasks and something
                                wrapped in cloth - before leaning in to kiss Mako on the forehead, pausing for a moment,
                                smiling and leaving for the town.
                                <br><br>
                                A few nights later, her mother had returned home and prepared an evening meal. As they
                                ate, they were abruptly interrupted by the door to their small home crashing inwards as
                                several armed men of the Moon Guard spilled in through the open doorway. Kinna reached
                                for her daughter but was grabbed by several of the men held Mako still. These men took
                                her mother' life before her, ignoring the pleas from the woman and child. Mako had
                                watched the fear in her mother's eyes and felt entirely helpless.
                                <br><br>
                                Once her mother lay still on the floor, after looking to a man in nicer armor than the
                                rest and asking "Omet, the child?" The man who held her began pulling her outside. The
                                men spoke further, but she could not hear them through her screams. Mako punched and
                                kicked at his legs as she was pulled, and when her fear reached its peak, she felt
                                something manifest in her hand and as she swung down, pierced the man's thigh with an
                                unseen blade. The second she bought herself was enough, and she ran into the woods until
                                her lungs burned, and her legs could no longer carry her.

                                For a few months, she barely survived in the nearby wood. Hungry and exhausted, she saw
                                a fire through the trees and in her desperation walked towards it. There she found a
                                small community of lesser who lived a short while from her village, who didn't hesitate
                                to feed and warm her. She lived within this community for several years, finding a home
                                with a halfling woman named Hillie, who also functioned as a face for the village when
                                any people outside the community visited, making sure to keep any Orc in the community
                                hidden.
                                <br><br>
                                There were several children of similar age here, and Mako slowly started the healing
                                from her loss and built a close friendship with a young Orc called Gom. The two
                                playfully fought each other, and Mako relished her their friendship.
                                <br><br>
                                On Occasion, a human man named Theron would visit the camp. He seemed to like the
                                lesser, and Mako would interrogate him every time he visited, eventually learning that
                                he worked in Wamriec and was often on the road. He began showing her tricks with his
                                daggers, and the two formed a small bond - the Half-Orc girl would often ask him to take
                                her with him, and he always refused. Theron was a kind man. He was sympathetic to the
                                lesser and didn't have issue with her pale green skin or the tusks jutting from her
                                lower lip.
                                <br><br>
                                One afternoon, when Mako was twelve years old, she waited for Theron to leave his cart
                                unattended, grabbed her small pack of belongings, left notes for Hallie and Gom, and
                                climbed into the back of his cart, finding a hidden place between some crates covered by
                                a thick tarp. By the time Theron noticed her presence, it was too late to turn around.
                                When they arrived at Wamriec, he took her under his wing, inducting her into the White
                                Ink.

                                Following the shift in the White Ink after the appearence of the moonblight, and with
                                their shift towards increasing tension between the Mahldor and Cindaval borders to
                                increase the efficiency of their drug smuggling, it became clear to Mako that the White
                                Ink wasn't what it first appeared to be. The more she learned about it, the less she
                                liked it. Along with this, Theron had started to visit lesser villages less and less,
                                and eventually stopped entirely. They often argued about this, Mako insisting that he
                                should still help, but Theron stood his ground and refused, insisting it was no longer
                                safe.
                                <br><br>
                                When Mako was eighteen years old and she was in Port Haelik working with Theron, they
                                had their largest argument yet. In her anger, she left and never turned back, finding
                                her way onto a ship to Mahldor, where she made her way to Kazwen where she worked,
                                frequently travelling to nearby towns for work while trying to find any leads on her
                                father - but mostly just trying to get by.
